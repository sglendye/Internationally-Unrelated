Welcome to the Tiger Based Team's official blog. This is our little playground for producing (sometimes not so) small analyses and opinions on current affairs, international relations, public policy, history, economics, statistics, or anything else that we may wish to plague the world with. Does that sound interesting? If yes, then clearly you haven't actually *read* any of our content yet...

Huge credit to all involved in the Blogdown and Hugo Lithium projects. This website was produced using R's [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. The theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium). It was made shockingly easy to generate with their incredible work.
